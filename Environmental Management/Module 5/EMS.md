## Key elements / components of EMS

The stages of the EMS lifecycle process are as follows:

1. **Commitment and Policy** 
	- The top management of an organization is committed towards continuous improvement  to the environment and forms organizational environmental policies.
	- The environmental policy serves as the foundation of an EMS. 
	- It is a written statement that outlines the organization's commitment to environmental sustainability and sets the overall direction and goals for environmental management. 
	- The policy provides a framework for decision-making and guides the development of specific objectives and targets.

2. **Planning** 
	- An organization must identify different environmental aspects to carry out its operations. 
	- Environmental aspects mainly cover hazardous waste and air pollutants that may cause harm to the environment. 
	- Then the organization lays down certain rules and regulations that need to be followed by its employees for its smooth functioning
	- The planning element involves the identification of environmental aspects and impacts associated with the organization's activities, products, and services. 
	- It includes assessing risks and opportunities, setting objectives and targets for environmental performance improvement, and developing action plans and programs to achieve those targets. 
	- The planning process should consider legal and regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations, and the organization's context.

3. **Implementation** 
	- This stage is carried out in two steps. In the first step, an organization collects all its resources such as employees and financial resources and follows the action plan to achieve the set objectives. 
	- Its main aim is to provide quality training and awareness to all its employees. 
	- In the seconds step, the documentation process is done along with setting up of both internal and external communication channels.
	- This element focuses on implementing the planned actions and operationalizing the EMS within the organization. 
	- It includes defining roles and responsibilities, establishing procedures and processes, conducting employee training, and ensuring effective communication and documentation. 
	- Implementation and operation also involve monitoring and measuring environmental performance, conducting audits, and managing non-conformities.

4. **Evaluation** 
	- In this stage, the current execution steps are evaluated to analyze the performance and whether the required objectives are achieved or not. 
	- If not, then corrective measures need to be taken to meet the objective.
	- The checking element involves monitoring, measuring, and evaluating the organization's environmental performance against the defined objectives and targets. 
	- It includes conducting regular inspections, audits, and assessments to identify deviations, non-compliance, and areas for improvement. 
	- Corrective actions are then taken to address identified issues, prevent recurrence, and continually improve the EMS.

5. **Review** 
	- In this stage, the final computed result needs to analyzed by the top level management to verify that the EMS system is working or not. 
	- An organization should form policy without affecting any ethical values. 
	- Keeping its own values in mind. A review process creates a loop to improve organization goals.
	- The management review is a systematic evaluation of the EMS by top management to ensure its continued suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness. 
	- This review involves assessing the organization's environmental performance, reviewing compliance status, considering the need for changes or updates to the EMS, and providing resources and support for its improvement. 
	- Management review meetings drive continual improvement and decision-making based on the EMS's outputs and outcomes.

6. **Continuous Improvement**
	- Continuous improvement is an essential element of an EMS. 
	- It involves a cycle of ongoing enhancement to achieve better environmental performance. 
	- This includes regularly reviewing and updating objectives, targets, and action plans based on performance monitoring and management review outcomes. 
	- Organizations strive for continual improvement by implementing best practices, adopting new technologies, and learning from experience and feedback.
