# Hazardous Waste

A Hazardous Waste is a waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment. Examples include drain cleaners, oil paint, motor oil, antifreeze, fuel, poisons, pesticides, herbicides and rodenticides, fluorescent lamps, lamp ballasts, smoke detectors, medical waste, some types of cleaning chemicals, and consumer electronics (such as televisions, computers, and cell phones).

## Source of Hazardous Waste 

Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing process wastes to batteries and may come in many forms, including liquids, solids gases, and sludges. It includes 
1. Clinical wastes; 
2. Waste oils/water, hydrocarbons/water mixtures, emulsions; 
3. Wastes from the production, formulation and use of resins, latex, plasticizers, glues/adhesives; 
4. Wastes resulting from surface treatment of metals and plastics; 
5. Residues arising from industrial waste disposal operations; 
6. Wastes which contain certain compounds such as: copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury, lead and asbestos. 
7. Household waste; or Residues arising from the incineration of household

## Concern about Hazardous Waste 

1. Cause of mass life and material damage and loss (disability, death, fire, explosion) 
2. Cause of environmental damages: water, solid and air pollution (under ground and surface drinking water) 
3. Cause of potential increased chemical bioaccumulation that is hard for biodegradability (chlorine containing chemicals) 
4. Cause of long term irreversible health risks 
5. High concern of trans-boundary movement of toxic waste 
6. Cause of massive toxic health damages

## Classification of Hazardous Waste

### Listed Waste by US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA)

1. **F-List** 
	Wastes on this list are created from common manufacturing and industrial processes. Because these wastes are produced in multiple industries, they are known as “non-specific source waste.
1. **K-List** 
	Wastes, including sludge or wastewater, from a selection of specific industries, such as petroleum refining or pesticide manufacturing, are included on this list. Since we know the industry they are produced in, they are called "source-specific wastes".
2. **P-List and U-List** 
	Wastes on this lists are commercial chemical products being discarded in their unused form. They become hazardous when discarded

### Characterized Waste ( Based on characteristics of Hazardous Waste)

1. **Ignitability**
	something flammable. There are three types of ignitable forms: 
	1. Liquids with a flash point–the lowest temperature at which fumes above waste ignite of 60 degrees Celsius or 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Examples include alcohol, gasoline, and acetone.  
	2. Solids that spontaneously combust.
	3. Oxidizers and compressed gasses 
 
2. **Corrosivity**
	something that can rust or decompose Corrosive substances, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid, have the ability eat through containers, causing the leakage of harmful materials. A corrosive is anything liquid with a pH of less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5, or has the ability to corrode steel. Everyday example of corrosives include battery acid and rust removers

3. **Reactivity**
	something explosive Given their instability, reactive wastes can be very dangerous. The EPA recognizes that there are too many conditions and situations to identify all types of reactive materials. However, they use the following as guidelines to assist generators: 
	1. unstable, and routinely experiences violent change without detonating 
	2. potential for explosive mixture or violent reaction when combined with water 
	3. toxic gasses are released when mixed with water

4. **Toxicity**
	something poisonous Poisonous materials pose a threat to our groundwater, which can have long term effects to human health and the environment. This is different from the first three characteristic groups, which the EPA views as containing immediate and firsthand dangers. There are 60 contaminants on the toxicity characteristics list. These contaminants are identified solely through a test method called Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure or TCLP.

### Universal Waste
1. Batteries
2. Pesticides 
3. Equipment containing mercury 
4. Lamps containing mercury 

### Mixed Waste: Radioactive + Hazardous

### E-Waste: Electrical Waste, Electronic

## Hazardous Waste Control Measures

1. Source Reduction
	1. Technological Efficiency
	2. Material Substitute 
	3. Good Management Practice 
2. Waste Avoidance 
3. Waste Minimization 
4. Waste Recycling
	1. Direct Reuse
	2. Reclamation 
5. Waste Treatment 
6. Waste Disposal

## Hazardous Waste Treatment Methods

1. **Physical Methods**: 
	a) Drying b) Screening 
	c) Grinding d) Evaporation 
	e) Sedimentation f) Filtration 
	g) Fixation 
1. **Chemical Methods**: 
	a) Oxidation b) Reduction c) Neutralization d) Hydrolysis 
3. **Biological Methods**: 
	a) Composting b) Aerobic and Anaerobic Decomposition 
	c) Activated Sludge d) Enzyme treatment 
4. **Thermal Methods** 
	a) Incineration b) Boiling c) Autoclaving d) UV Treatment e) Microwave Use

## Hazardous Waste Disposal Methods 

1. **Land Farming**: Treated waste can be used as a fertilizer or soil conditioner 
2. **Surface Impediment**: Encapsulation, Fixation, or containment of the waste. This method involves arresting or demobilizing the movement or migration of waste by containing it in a hard core: clay soil, thermo plastic polymers, non-corrosive metallic containers etc. 
3. **Deep well Injection** 
4. **Ocean Dumping**
