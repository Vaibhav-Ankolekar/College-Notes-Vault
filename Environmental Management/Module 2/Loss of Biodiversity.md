# Loss of Biodiversity

Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you’ll find in one area—the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life. Biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and shelter. Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic (genetic variability), species (species diversity), and ecosystem (ecosystemdiversity) level.

Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth; it is usually greater in the tropics as a result of the warmclimate and high primary productivity in the region near the equator. 

## Three Different Levels of BioDiversity

- **Species Diversity** - Number of different species in the biosphere or in a particular region 
- **Genetic Diversity** - The amount of variation in the genetic material within all members of a population. 
- **Ecosystem Diversity** - Variety of habitats, living communities, and ecological processes in the living world

## Loss of Biodiversity 

Biodiversity Loss is termed as a decrease in biological diversity within a species, ecosystems, places and the earth as a whole. If there is a loss of a species in a given area or loss in the number and genetic variability of any area, it is often described as a loss in Biodiversity. 

About three-fourth of the human population resides in the Tropical regions which occupy only about onefourth of the total area of the world. The tropical rain forests contain 50 percent of the species on the earth. The excessive population is one of the causes that have lead to biodiversity loss that has resulted in the rampant exploitation of resources and deforestation. The destruction of the Tropical regions has resulted in the loss of natural habitats which is catastrophic for the whole biosphere. 

Natural calamities like forest fires, droughts, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, etc. cause damage to both flora and fauna of the earth. Pesticides and other pollutants like toxic heavy metals and hydrocarbons destroy the feeble and sensitive species

## Causes: 

1. **Habitat Alteration**
	Is a change in land use or land cover that has an impact on local ecosystems. This happens due to Farming practices, Clearing forests, Hydroelectric dams, Urbanization and suburban sprawl, Grazing animals and livestock 
2. **Invasive Species**
	Species that enter new ecosystems and multiply, harming native species and their habitats. Often were accidentally or even deliberately introduced by humans. The Introduction of non-native plants and animals to new environments make large damage and raise competition levels for resources 
3. **Pollution**
	Any matter or energy released into the environment that causes undesirable impacts on the health and well-being of humans or other organisms. Pollution caused by Water pollution, Agricultural runoff, Air pollution degrades, Oil and chemical spills 
4. **Overharvesting / Overuse**
	Overexploitation, refers to harvesting a renewable resource to the point of diminishing returns. 

## Measures to stop: 

Education, Protection of species, Protection of habitats, Stop deforestation, Prevent overhunting and overfishing, Prevent species invasion, Stop pollution
