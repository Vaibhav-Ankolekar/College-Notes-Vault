The environmental management profession is evolving with an increasingly strategic focus on environmental sustainability and social responsibility. While regulatory compliance management and environmental technical knowledge continue to be important aspects, the increasing emphasis on sustainability has expanded the role of the environmental manager toward more proactive and integrated management approaches within the organization.

Environmental managers serve a multifunctional role and continually strive for more sustainable practices that can be accomplished through more efficient processes and more eco-friendly raw materials. 

Effective environmental professionals must serve a "cross functional, diverse, multi-level, change agent role".

Today‘s environmental managers serve as internal facilitators, guiding and enabling sustainability efforts across multiple functional areas within the firm while simultaneously serving as the environmental stewards of the corporate world, managing the relationship between the firm and the environment.

Internal and external communication is an important overarching aspect of the environmental manager‘s role as a means to raise awareness among key stakeholders. In providing stakeholders with accurate information about environmental and social factors related to products and services. 

Organizations are considering environmental impacts from a broader perspective, engaging numerous functional areas within the firm in environmental issues, including plant managers, product designers, and research and development departments. Environmental managers can create internal relationships to integrate environmental practices throughout the business and are critical in developing the firm‘s policies and programs to achieve scientific objectives related to environmental impacts and sustainability as well as evaluating whether these efforts can succeed in advancing sustainability within the context of the organization and its business framework.

Generally environmental managers have clearly defined responsibilities related to environmental aspects and impacts, including the reduction of negative environmental impacts of the organization‘s processes, maintaining regulatory compliance, and avoiding unnecessary environmental liabilities.

Their technical knowledge, problem-solvingabilities, and management skills can advance environmental stewardship in the organization .They often interact with personnel at all levels of the organization from workers on the production floor to upper management. These contacts place them in an excellent position to determine issues, possible opportunities, and solutions throughout the organization. Often environmental managers must break down barriers within companies since they work with nearly all aspects of the organization. This ability promotes not only stronger organizational governance but also allows for better early detection of issues since communication is more open.

In addition, environmental managers have a role in raising environmental awareness of all members of the organization.. Their interaction with others across the organization positions them for vertical and horizontal communication to ensure that every member of the organization can know current internal events and can have a voice to upper management. 

Internal stakeholders may not be fully aware of the organization‘s environmental and social responsibility efforts and metrics, and raising awareness can further enable collaboration and provide the firm with a greater chance of success in pursuing its. Environmental managers can provide adequate training to all employees in terms of reducing environmental impacts and promoting social responsibility, since both of these requires active and knowledgeable participation from all employees at an organization.

The external role of the environmental manager deals with environmental sustainability in managing the relationship between the firm and the environment but is also linked to social responsibility. The global public holds companies to an increasing expectation to become more socially responsible and improve the welfare of society, and socioeconomic, social, and environmental factors have become part of measuring a company‘s performance. Since the environment directly relates to and affects society, social responsibility partly falls on the shoulders of environmental managers. Environmental managers have taken on responsibilities related to sustainable resource use, restoring the environment, and mitigating climate change, in addition to their traditional roles in protecting the environment and preventing pollution.

Environmental managers play a role also in external environmental communication and awareness, including reporting on the firm‘s progress toward environmental initiatives, responding to stakeholder inquiries about environmental performance and sustainability, and engaging the supply chain. External communication with interested parties, including suppliers, industry groups, academia, and public interest groups, is critical with respect to raising awareness, collaboration, and transparency.

Human rights activities are of specific concern also, since often environmental issues can lead to human rights violations. Environmental managers take a more active role in these activities and that they consider the implications of every process that may challenge human rights.

Environmental managers to fully perform their responsibilities, they must break down barriers within the organization to join forces with the numerous functional units with which they interact Environmental managers could collaborate with: 

- health and safety, operations, and facility management functional areas to complete many pollution prevention, sustainable resource use, and climate change-related action items;
- health and safety, operations, and human resources functional areas on matters related to health and safety at work and employee skills development; 
- purchasing professionals on supplier selection and development activities;
- operations and health and safety professionals on consumer health and safety issues; and
- operations and human resources professionals on organizational governance issues related to ethics and stakeholder expectations.
