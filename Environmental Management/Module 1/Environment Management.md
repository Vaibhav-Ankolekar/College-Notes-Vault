Environment management is the process of allocating natural and man-made resources so as to make optimum use of the environment in satisfying not only the existing basic human needs but of the coming generations also. This management implies an element of conscious choice from a variety of alternative proposals and furthermore that such a choice involves purposeful commitment for recognized and desired objectives.
