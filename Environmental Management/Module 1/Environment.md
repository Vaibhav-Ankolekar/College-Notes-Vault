**Environmental Policy**: overall intentions and direction of an organization related to its environmental performance as formally expressed by top management.

## Classification of Environment

Environment classified into two components 
1. Non-living or Physical component or Abiotic component 
2. Living or Biological or Biotic component

### Non-living or Physical component or Abiotic component

Classified into three components

#### Atmosphere (Air)

This includes the regions of troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere of our environment which are present at different altitude ranges and comprise of various chemical components

#### Hydrosphere (Water) 

Consists of surface, ground and oceanic waters. 70% of earth‘s surface is water. 70% of our body weight is also water. Water is a medium of all biochemical reactions in plants and animals. The waters of the oceans have an almost uniform composition. Nearly 80 elements occur in sea water, which can be source for their extraction in future. At present, salt, magnesium and its compound and bromine are produced from sea water. It accounts for Clean water for drinking (a metabolic requirement of all living process), Water for washing, cooking, in agriculture, industry, for creating hydro power, Food resources from sea. Around 3% of water is in extreme locations incl glaciers

#### Lithosphere (Land) 

This comprises of : Stone, sand, gravel used in construction. Soil, the basis of agriculture to provide food. Micronutrients in soil, essential for plant growth. A large no. of minerals on which industries are based. Microscopic flora, smallsoil fauna, and fungi in soil important living organisms of the lithosphere, which breaks down plant litter as well as animal wastes to provide nutrients for plants. Oil, Coal and Gas extracted from underground sources, it provides power to vehicles, agriculture machinery, industry, and for our homes. Lithosphere begin as a hot ball of matter which formed the earth about 4.6 billion years ago. About 3.2 billion years ago, the Earth cooled down considerably and very special event took place - Life began on our planet.

### Living or Biological or Biotic component

These components include living organisms, these are 
1. Plants 
2. Microbes 
3. Animals including Mankind
