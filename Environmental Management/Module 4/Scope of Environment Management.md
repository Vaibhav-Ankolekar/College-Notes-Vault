# Scope of Environment Management

The scope of an Environmental Management System (EMS) refers to the boundaries and extent of an organization's environmental management efforts. 

It defines the environmental aspects, activities, products, services, and geographical locations that are included within the organization's environmental management framework. The scope sets the boundaries for which an organization will identify, assess, control, and improve its environmental performance.

Environmental management is very wide in scope and includes all the technical, economical and other aspects of environment.

*The broader objectives of environmental management includes:*

1. To identify the environmental problem and to find its solution.
2. To restrict and regulate the exploitation and utilization of natural resources.
3. To regenerate degraded environment and to renew natural resources (renewable)
4. To control environmental pollution and gradation.
5. To reduce the impacts of extreme events and natural disaster.
6. To make optimum utilization of natural resources.
7. To assess the impacts of proposed projects and activities on environment.
8. To review and revise the existing technologies and make them ecofriendly.
9. To formulate laws for the implementation of environmental protection and conservation programmes.

Here are some key aspects of the scope of an EMS:

1. **Organizational Boundaries**: The scope of an EMS defines the organizational boundaries within which the environmental management system applies. It clarifies whether the EMS covers the entire organization or specific divisions, departments, or sites.

2. **Geographical Boundaries**: The scope may specify the geographic locations or operational sites covered by the EMS. This ensures that environmental management practices are applied consistently across all relevant sites or regions.

3. **Activities and Processes**: The scope identifies the activities, processes, and operations that are included in the EMS. It covers the full range of an organization's environmental aspects, such as energy use, waste management, water consumption, emissions, and other significant environmental impacts.

4. **Products and Services**: The scope of the EMS may specify the products and services that are included in the environmental management framework. It ensures that the organization considers the environmental aspects and impacts associated with its offerings throughout their life cycle, including design, production, use, and disposal.

5. **External Factors**: The scope may consider external factors such as suppliers, contractors, and outsourced activities that have significant environmental impacts. It helps in assessing the environmental performance of the organization's value chain and supply chain.

6. **Legal and Regulatory Requirements**: The scope includes compliance obligations, applicable laws, regulations, and other requirements related to environmental management. It ensures that the organization addresses legal requirements and strives for continual improvement beyond compliance.

7. **Stakeholder Expectations**: The scope may consider the expectations of stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, communities, and NGOs. It helps in identifying and addressing the environmental concerns and expectations of interested parties.

8. **Scope Exclusions**: The scope of the EMS may also define any specific exclusions or limitations, such as activities or aspects that are not applicable or do not have significant environmental impacts. These exclusions should be justified and documented.

Defining the scope of the EMS is an important initial step in developing and implementing an effective environmental management system. It provides clarity and direction for the organization's environmental management efforts, ensuring a systematic approach to environmental performance improvement and sustainability.

## General scheme for environmental management

The general scheme for environmental management typically follows a systematic approach to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable practices. Here is a breakdown of the steps involved:

**STEP I: Identification of objectives and define problems**
- Identify the environmental objectives and goals to be achieved.
- Assess and identify the specific environmental problems, issues, or challenges that need to be addressed.
- Conduct surveys, studies, and data collection to gather information about the current state of the environment and potential impacts.

**STEP II: Determination of appropriate action plan**
- Develop an action plan that outlines the strategies, measures, and activities required to address the identified problems and achieve the environmental objectives.
- Consider scientific knowledge, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder input when designing the action plan.
- Determine the necessary resources, budget, and timeline for implementation.

**STEP III: Implementation & progress evaluation**
- Implement the action plan by executing the identified strategies and activities.
- Monitor and evaluate the progress of implementation to ensure that the planned actions are being carried out effectively.
- Assess the effectiveness of the implemented measures in achieving the desired environmental outcomes.
- Adjust the implementation approach if necessary based on the evaluation findings.

**STEP IV: Monitoring & adjust management**
- Continuously monitor and assess the environmental conditions, trends, and the effectiveness of the management measures.
- Collect and analyze data on key environmental indicators to track progress and identify any emerging issues or new challenges.
- Regularly review and update the management strategies and measures based on the monitoring results and changing circumstances.
- Consider feedback from stakeholders and incorporate new scientific knowledge or technological advancements.

**STEP V: Future environmental management and planning**
- Use the knowledge gained from previous steps to inform future environmental management and planning efforts.
- Identify opportunities for improvement and identify new objectives or goals based on changing priorities or emerging environmental issues.
- Develop long-term strategies and plans that consider sustainability, resilience, and the integration of environmental considerations into decision-making processes.
- Engage stakeholders, communicate the progress and achievements, and promote the importance of environmental management for the well-being of the environment and society.

It's important to note that the specific steps and their sequence may vary depending on the context, scale, and nature of the environmental management project or program. Additionally, active stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and effective communication are essential throughout the entire process to ensure the success and acceptance of environmental management efforts.

## Challenges faced in Environment Management

Implementing and maintaining an effective Environmental Management System (EMS) can pose various challenges for organizations. Some common challenges faced in environment management systems include:

1. **Complex Regulatory Framework**: Compliance with environmental regulations and standards can be challenging due to the complexity and constant evolution of environmental laws. Organizations must stay updated on changing requirements and ensure their EMS aligns with the applicable regulations.

2. **Resource Constraints**: Allocating sufficient resources, including financial, human, and technological resources, can be a challenge for implementing and maintaining an EMS. Organizations may struggle with budget limitations, inadequate staffing, and a lack of necessary infrastructure or technology to effectively manage environmental aspects.

3. **Cultural and Organizational Change**: Implementing an EMS often requires a cultural shift within an organization. Resistance to change, lack of awareness or commitment from employees, and a lack of integration of environmental considerations into the organization's values and practices can hinder the successful implementation of an EMS.

4. **Data Collection and Monitoring**: Gathering accurate and reliable data on environmental performance indicators can be challenging. Organizations may face difficulties in data collection, monitoring, and reporting due to limited access to data, lack of standardized measurement methods, and the need for robust data management systems.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, and local communities, in environmental management initiatives can be challenging. Balancing diverse stakeholder expectations, fostering effective communication, and encouraging active participation require dedicated efforts and effective stakeholder engagement strategies.

6. **Integration with Business Processes**: Integrating environmental considerations into core business processes and decision-making can be a challenge. Organizations need to align their environmental objectives with their overall business strategies, which may involve overcoming resistance, identifying opportunities for improvement, and ensuring that environmental considerations are embedded in day-to-day operations.
