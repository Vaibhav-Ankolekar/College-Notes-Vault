### Q1. List all the components of EMS

![[component-of-ems.svg]]

The stages of the EMS lifecycle process are as follows:

1. ***Commitment and Policy*** - The top management of an organization is committed towards continuous improvement  to the environment and forms organizational environmental policies.

2. ***Planning*** -  An organization must identify different environmental aspects to carry out its operations. Environmental aspects mainly cover hazardous waste and air pollutants that may cause harm to the environment. Then the organization lays down certain rules and regulations that need to be followed by its employees for its smooth functioning

3. ***Implementation*** - This stage is carried out in two steps. In the first step, an organization collects all its resources such as employees and financial resources and follows the action plan to achieve the set objectives. Its main aim is to provide quality training and awareness to all its employees. In the seconds step, the documentation process is done along with setting up of both internal and external communication channels.

4. ***Evaluation*** - In this stage, the current execution steps are evaluated to analyze the performance and whether the required objectives are achieved or not. If not, then corrective measures need to be taken to meet the objective.

5. ***Review*** - In this stage, the final computed result needs to analyzed by the top level management to verify that the EMS system is working or not. An organization should form policy without affecting any ethical values. Keeping its own values in mind. A review process creates a loop to improve organization goals.

ISO 14000 is a framework for environmental management that follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. This cycle is a systematic approach to continuous improvement that can be applied to any management system. Here is a breakdown of how the PDCA cycle applies to the ISO 14000 framework:

1. ***Plan*** 
	- In this phase, an organization establishes its environmental policy and objectives. 
	- It identifies the environmental impacts of its activities, products or services, and sets targets for improvement. 
	- The organization must also define the processes needed to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

2. ***Do*** 
	- In this phase, the organization implements the processes and procedures that it has established in the planning phase. 
	- This includes the training of employees, the establishment of communication channels, and the implementation of the procedures to control its environmental impacts.

3. ***Check*** 
	- In this phase, the organization monitors and measures its environmental performance against its targets and objectives. 
	- This includes checking compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, identifying and correcting non-conformities, and assessing the effectiveness of its management system.

4. ***Act*** 
	- In this phase, the organization takes action to continuously improve its environmental performance based on the results of the check phase. 
	- This may involve updating policies and objectives, modifying processes and procedures, providing additional training, or making other improvements to the management system.

The PDCA cycle is an iterative process, meaning that the organization repeats the cycle continuously to achieve ongoing improvement. Through this process, an organization can improve its environmental performance, reduce its environmental impact, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and requirements.
