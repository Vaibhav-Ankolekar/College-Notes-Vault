![[component-of-ems.svg]]

The stages of the EMS lifecycle process are as follows:

1. ***Commitment and Policy*** - The top management of an organization is committed towards continuous improvement  to the environment and forms organizational environmental policies.

2. ***Planning*** -  An organization must identify different environmental aspects to carry out its operations. Environmental aspects mainly cover hazardous waste and air pollutants that may cause harm to the environment. Then the organization lays down certain rules and regulations that need to be followed by its employees for its smooth functioning

3. ***Implementation*** - This stage is carried out in two steps. In the first step, an organization collects all its resources such as employees and financial resources and follows the action plan to achieve the set objectives. Its main aim is to provide quality training and awareness to all its employees. In the seconds step, the documentation process is done along with setting up of both internal and external communication channels.

4. ***Evaluation*** - In this stage, the current execution steps are evaluated to analyze the performance and whether the required objectives are achieved or not. If not, then corrective measures need to be taken to meet the objective.

5. ***Review*** - In this stage, the final computed result needs to analyzed by the top level management to verify that the EMS system is working or not. An organization should form policy without affecting any ethical values. Keeping its own values in mind. A review process creates a loop to improve organization goals.
