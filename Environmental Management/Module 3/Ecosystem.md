# Ecosystem

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the non-living components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 

The concept of ecosystem is possible at several scales of magnitude. From multicellular organisms such as insects animals or plants to lakes, mountain ranges or forests to the planet Earth as a whole. 

## Components of Ecosystem 

Biotic components are the living things that have a direct or indirect influence on other organisms in an environment. For example, plants, animals, and microorganisms and their waste materials. 

Abiotic components of an ecosystem include all chemical and physical elements i.e. non-living components. Abiotic components can vary from region to region, from one ecosystem to another. They mainly take up the role of life supporter. They determine and restrict the population growth, number, and diversity of biotic factors in an ecosystem. Hence they are called limiting factors.

## Types of Ecosystem 

There are many types of ecosystems, but the three major classes of ecosystems, sometimes referred to as ‘biomes’, which are relatively contained, are the following:
- Freshwater Ecosystems
- Terrestrial Ecosystems
- Ocean Ecosystems 

### Freshwater Ecosystems 

Freshwater ecosystems are those that are contained to freshwater environments. This includes, but is not limited to, ponds, rivers and other waterways that are not the sea. Freshwater ecosystems are actually the smallest of the three major classes of ecosystems, accounting for just 1.8% of the total of the Earth’s surface. These can then be broken up into smaller ecosystems. 

For instance, in the freshwater ecosystems we find:
- Pond Ecosystems – These are usually relatively small and contained. Most of the time they include various types of plants, amphibians and insects. Sometimes they include fish, but as these cannot move around as easily as amphibians and insects, it is less likely, and most of the time fish are artificially introduced to these environments by humans.
- River Ecosystems – Because rivers always link to the sea, they are more likely to contain fish alongside the usual plants, amphibians and insects. These sorts of ecosystems can also include birds because birds often hunt in and around water for small fish or insects. 

### Terrestrial ecosystems 

Terrestrial ecosystems are many because there are so many different sorts of places on Earth. 

Some of the most common terrestrial ecosystems that are found are the following:
- Rainforests – Rainforests usually have extremely dense ecosystems because there are so many different types of animals all living in a very small area.
- Tundra – The tundra is a region in continents of Asia, Europe and North America where growth of trees does not happen due to relatively freezing temperature. The tundra biome is an ecosystem located at the North Pole. Tundra usually have relatively simple ecosystems because of the limited amount of life that can be supported in these harsh conditions.
- Deserts – Quite the opposite of tundra in many ways, but still harsh, more animals live in the extreme heat than live in the extreme cold of Antarctica, for instance.
- Savannas – A savanna is a mixed woodland- grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. These differ from deserts because of the amount of rain that they get each year. Whereas deserts get only a tiny amount of precipitation every tea, savannas tend to be a bit wetter which is better for supporting more life. 
- Forests – There are many different types of forests all over the world including deciduous forests and coniferous forests. These can support a lot of life and can have very complex ecosystems. 
- Grasslands – Grasslands support a wide variety of life and can have very complex and involved ecosystems.  

Because terrestrial ecosystems are so diverse, it is difficult to make generalizations about them. 

### Ocean ecosystems 

Ocean ecosystems are relatively contained, although they, like freshwater ecosystems, also include certain birds that hunt for fish and insects close to the ocean’s surface. 

Ocean ecosystems are amongst some of the most interesting in the world, especially in warm waters such as those of the Pacific Ocean. This is not least because around 75% of the Earth is covered by the sea, which means that there is lots of space for all sorts of different creatures to live and thrive. 

There are different sorts of ocean ecosystems: 
- Shallow water – Some tiny fish and coral only live in the shallow waters close to land.
- Deep water – Big and even gigantic creatures can live deep in the waters of the oceans. Some of the strangest creatures in the world live right at the bottom of the sea.
- Warm water – Warmer waters, such as those of the Pacific Ocean, contain some of the most impressive and intricate ecosystems in the world.
- Cold water – Less diverse, cold waters still support relatively complex ecosystems. Plankton usually formthe base of the food chain, following by small fish that are either eaten by bigger fish or by other creatures such as seals or penguins.
