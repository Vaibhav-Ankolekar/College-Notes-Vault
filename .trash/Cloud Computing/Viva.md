## How XenServer and XenCenter works ?

To connect XenCenter to XenServer, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install XenServer on a physical server or a virtual machine.
2. Install XenCenter on a separate computer that is connected to the same network as the XenServer host.
3. Open XenCenter and click on "Add a New Server" in the "Home" tab.
4. In the "Add Server" dialog box, enter the IP address or hostname of the XenServer host in the "Server" field.
5. Enter the username and password for the XenServer host in the "Username" and "Password" fields.
6. (Optional) Check the "Use SSL" checkbox if you want to use a secure connection to the XenServer host.
7. Click "Add" to add the XenServer host to XenCenter.
8. Once added, the XenServer host should appear in the XenCenter console, and you can manage it using the various options and tools provided in the console.

Note that you may need to adjust your firewall settings to allow XenCenter to connect to the XenServer host, and make sure that both the XenServer host and the XenCenter computer are on the same network and can communicate with each other.
