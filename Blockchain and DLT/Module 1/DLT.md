# What is DLT

- It is the consensus of replicated, shared and synchronized digital data that is geographically spread across many sites, countries or organizations
- It requires peer-to-peer computer network and consensus algorithm so that the ledger is reliably replicated across distributed computer nodes
- It is a broad term describing shared databases
- All blockchains are fundamentally distributed ledgers, all distributed ledgers are not necessarily a blockchain
- DLT data structure includes
	- Linear data structure (blockchain)
	- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
	- Hybrid data structures
- DLT consensus algorithm types include
	- proof-of-work (PoW)
	- proof-of-state (PoS)
	- DAG consensus-building and voting algorithm
- DLTs are generally either
	- permissioned (private)
	- or permissionless (public)
- PoW cryptocurrencies are generally either 'mined' or 'non-mined'
- PoS cryptocurrencies do not use miners, instead rely on validation among owners of the cryptocurrency


# DLT v/s Blockchain

| DLT | Blockchain |
|-|-|
| It is a superset | It is a subset of DLT |
| Consensus model may or may not be required as limited number of nodes can participate | Consensus model is required as anyone can participate and contribute|
| Blocks can be organized in different forms | Blocks are added in form of chain |
| Tokens are not required | Tokens are required |
| Blocks can be arranged in any sequence | Blocks are arranged in particular sequence |
| High efficiency with minimal cost | Low efficiency than DLT |
| Trust among participating nodes is high | Trust among participating nodes is less that DLT |
| More scalable as it does not need proof of work | Less scalable due to power of work consensus mechanism |
| Data or Access is not lost due to no use of keys authentication | Data and Access can be lost if the key is lost |
