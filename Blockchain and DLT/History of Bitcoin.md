- Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper title *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* written under the alias of *Satoshi Nakamoto*
- Nakamoto combined b-money and HashCash to create completely decentralized electronic cash system
- The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (the PoW algorithm) to conduct a global *election* every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions
- This solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice
- The double-spend problem was previously a weakness of digital currency
---
- The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by Nakamoto
- The implementation of Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and flexibility for bitcoin has increased exponentially in power
- Bitcoin's total market value has exceeded $35 billion US dollars
- The largest transaction processed so far by the network was $150 million US dollars

- Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April 2011, leaving the responsibility of developing the code and network to a group of volunteers
- The identity of person or people behind bitcoin is still unknown
- Neither Nakamoto nor anyone else individually control over the bitcoin system
- It operates based on
	- fully transparent mathematical principles,
	- open source code and
	- consensus among participants
