- Bitcoin is based on *cryptography*
- Cryptography can be used to prove knowledge of secret without revealing that secret (digital signature) or prove the authentication of data (digital fingerprint)
---
- Ownership of bitcoin is shown through **digital keys**, **bitcoin addresses** and **digital signatures**
- The digital keys are not actually stored in the network but are created and stored by users in a file or simple database called a **wallet**
- Keys are independent of the bitcoin protocol
- They can be created and managed by user's wallet software without reference to the blockchain
- Keys can be useful for
	- decentralized trust and control
	- ownership attestation
	- cryptographic proof security model
