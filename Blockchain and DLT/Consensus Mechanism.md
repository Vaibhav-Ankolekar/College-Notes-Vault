- backbone of blockchain
- provides decentralization of control
- choice of consensus algorithm is based on the type of blockchain used
- not all consensus mechanisms are suitable for all types of blockchain
- for e.g. in public permissionless blockchain, it would make sense to use Proof-of-Work instead of Proof-of-Authority
- it is essential to choose an appropriate consensus algorithm for a particular blockchain
