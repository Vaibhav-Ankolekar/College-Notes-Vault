# DBMS vs DSMS

|  | DBMS | DSMS |
|-:|-|-|
| Data Type | DBMS is designed to manage persistent data in the form of relations | DSMS is designed to handle volatile data streams |
| Access Type | DBMS allows random access to data | DSMS allows sequential access to data streams |
| Query Type | DBMS handles one-time queries | DSMS handles continuous queries |
| Storage Capacity | DBMS can theoretically handle unlimited secondary storage | DSMS is designed to work with limited main memory |
| Data Consistency | DBMS assumes that data is exact and consistent | DSMS assumes that data is outdated and inaccurate |
| Update Rate | DBMS has a relatively low update rate | DSMS can potentially have an extremely high update rate |
| Real-time Requirements | DBMS has little or no time requirements | DSMS is designed to handle real-time requirements |
| Query Processing | DBMS assumes plannable query processing | DSMS considers the order of input data arrival and data characteristics |
| Scalability | DBMS is designed for scalability to handle large data volumes | DSMS is designed for scalability to handle large data streams |
| Data Integration | DBMS focuses on data integration and consistency across multiple sources | DSMS focuses on real-time processing and analysis of data streams from multiple sources |
