# Roles and Effect of Page Rank

### Roles:
1. **Ranking web pages:** The Pagerank algorithm's primary role is to rank web pages based on their perceived importance and relevance, as measured by the quality and quantity of links pointing to them.
2. **Evaluating link quality:** Pagerank also plays a role in evaluating the quality of incoming links to a web page, taking into account factors like the relevance of the linking page and the anchor text used in the link.
3. **Improving search engine results:** By ranking web pages based on relevance and quality, Pagerank helps search engines provide more accurate and useful search results to users.
4. **Discouraging spam:** Pagerank's emphasis on quality and relevance can also discourage spammy practices like link farming and keyword stuffing, which can negatively affect search engine rankings.
5. **Informing SEO practices:** The Pagerank algorithm can also provide valuable insights to webmasters and SEO practitioners looking to improve their search engine rankings, helping them understand what types of links and content are most likely to be seen as valuable by search engines.

### Effects:

1. **Encouraging link building:** The Pagerank algorithm has encouraged webmasters to build links to their sites, which can help improve their search engine rankings.
2. **Increasing competition:** Pagerank has also led to increased competition among webmasters for high-quality links, as links from reputable sites can be especially valuable for improving search engine rankings.
3. **Shaping the internet:** The Pagerank algorithm has had a significant impact on the structure and content of the internet, as webmasters and content creators seek to create high-quality pages that are likely to rank well in search engine results.
4. **Reducing reliance on keyword density:** Prior to the development of the Pagerank algorithm, search engines relied heavily on factors like keyword density to determine relevance. Pagerank has helped to shift the focus more towards link quality and relevance, reducing the importance of factors like keyword density.
5. **Facilitating discovery:** Finally, the Pagerank algorithm has made it easier for users to discover relevant content on the web, by ranking pages based on their perceived importance and relevance. This has helped to democratize access to information and make the internet more accessible to users around the world.
