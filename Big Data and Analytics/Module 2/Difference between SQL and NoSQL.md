|  | SQL | NoSQL |
|-:|-|-|
| Data Model | SQL databases use a rigid, predefined schema | NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means the structure of the data can be changed at any time |
| Query Language | SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying data | NoSQL databases use query languages that are specific to their type, such as MongoDB's query language |
| Data Structure | SQL databases use tables to store data in a structured manner | NoSQL databases use a variety of data structures, such as documents, key-value pairs, and graphs |
| Scalability | SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they require more powerful hardware to handle increased loads | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means they can scale by adding more servers to the database cluster |
| Consistency | SQL databases are ACID compliant, which means they offer strong consistency | NoSQL databases are often BASE (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent) compliant, which means they offer eventual consistency |
| Performance | SQL databases are often faster for complex queries that require multiple table joins | NoSQL databases are faster for simple queries that require less computation |
| Data Storage | SQL databases are optimized for storing structured data | NoSQL databases are optimized for storing unstructured data |
| Cost | SQL databases are often more expensive than NoSQL databases, as they require more expensive hardware and software licenses | NoSQL databases are often less expensive than SQL databases |
| Use Cases | SQL databases are commonly used for traditional transactional systems, such as banking and finance | NoSQL databases are commonly used for big data, web applications, and real-time analytics |
| Development | SQL databases have been around for many years and have a well-established ecosystem of tools and resources |  NoSQL databases are relatively new and are still evolving, with a less established ecosystem of tools and resources |
