Here are two real-world applications of each NoSQL architecture pattern:

1. Document-Based NoSQL Databases:
- MongoDB is used in a variety of applications. One example is e-commerce websites, which need to store a large amount of product data in a flexible and scalable way. MongoDB's document-based architecture allows e-commerce companies to store product information and images in a single document, making it easier to retrieve and display product information quickly to customers. 
- Apache CouchDB, which is used in the healthcare industry to store patient data. CouchDB's document-based architecture allows healthcare providers to store patient information such as medical history, lab results, and diagnosis in a single document, making it easier to manage and share information between different providers.

2. Key-Value NoSQL Databases:
- Redis is used in a variety of applications, including real-time messaging, gaming, and ad targeting. For example, Redis is used in online gaming to store player data such as scores, inventory, and achievements in a fast and scalable way. 
- Riak, which is used in the financial industry to store transaction data. Riak's key-value architecture allows financial institutions to store and retrieve transaction data quickly and efficiently, making it easier to analyze and detect fraud.

3. Column-Family NoSQL Databases:
- Apache Cassandra is used in a variety of applications, including social media, IoT, and online advertising. For example, Cassandra is used in social media to store user profiles and activity data in a scalable and flexible way. 
- HBase, which is used in the telecommunications industry to store call detail records (CDRs). HBase's column-family architecture allows telecom providers to store and analyze massive amounts of call data, making it easier to detect network issues and optimize network performance.

4. Graph-Based NoSQL Databases:
- Neo4j is used in a variety of applications, including recommendation engines, social networks, and fraud detection. For example, Neo4j is used in recommendation engines to model user behavior and recommend products or content based on that behavior. 
- Amazon Neptune is used in the financial industry to detect fraudulent activity. Neptune's graph-based architecture allows financial institutions to model complex relationships between users, accounts, and transactions, making it easier to detect patterns of fraud.
