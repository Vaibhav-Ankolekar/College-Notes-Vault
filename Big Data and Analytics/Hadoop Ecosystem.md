# Components

## HDFS

- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is the primary storage system used in the Hadoop ecosystem. 
- It is a distributed file system that is designed to store and manage large volumes of data across multiple commodity servers.
- HDFS provides a scalable and fault-tolerant storage solution for big data applications. 
- It uses a master-slave architecture, where a single NameNode manages the file system namespace and controls access to files, and multiple DataNodes store the actual data. 
- The data is replicated across multiple DataNodes to ensure redundancy and high availability.
- HDFS is optimized for storing and processing large files, such as those used in Hadoop MapReduce jobs. 
- It supports append operations and can be used with various file formats, including text, CSV, and Avro.
- One of the key benefits of HDFS is its ability to scale horizontally by adding more commodity servers to the cluster. 
- This allows organizations to store and process massive amounts of data without having to invest in expensive storage solutions.

## MapReduce

- MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework that is a core component of the Hadoop ecosystem. 
- It is used to process and analyze large volumes of data in parallel across distributed computing resources.
- The MapReduce model consists of two main stages: the map stage and the reduce stage. In the map stage, input data is divided into chunks and processed in parallel by multiple nodes in the cluster. 
- Each node applies a mapping function to its assigned data chunk, producing a set of intermediate key-value pairs.
- In the reduce stage, the intermediate results from the map stage are combined and reduced to a final output. 
- Each reduce node receives a subset of the intermediate key-value pairs and applies a reduce function to produce a final result.
- One of the key benefits of MapReduce is its ability to process and analyze massive amounts of data in parallel, making it ideal for big data applications. 
- MapReduce is also highly flexible and can be used to implement a wide range of data processing tasks, including data cleansing, data aggregation, and machine learning.

## HBase

- HBase is a distributed NoSQL database that is a part of the Hadoop ecosystem.

- Zookeeper can also be used to coordinate the distributed processing of data by Hadoop applications.

## Oozie

- Oozie is a workflow scheduler system for managing Hadoop jobs in the Hadoop ecosystem. 
- It is used to define and run complex workflows that can involve multiple Hadoop jobs or other types of tasks.
- Oozie allows users to define workflows using a combination of XML and Java code. 
- Workflows can include actions such as MapReduce jobs, Pig scripts, Hive queries, and shell commands. 
- These actions can be executed in a sequential or parallel manner, depending on the requirements of the workflow.
- Oozie provides a web-based interface for managing workflows, as well as a command-line interface for automation and scripting. 
- It also includes features for monitoring and tracking the progress of workflows, as well as for managing errors and retries.
- One of the key benefits of Oozie is that it enables users to automate and manage complex Hadoop workflows, which can be challenging to do manually. 
- By using Oozie, users can schedule and execute workflows on a regular basis, as well as handle dependencies and error handling in a systematic manner.

## Pig

- Pig is a high-level data processing language and platform that is a part of the Hadoop ecosystem. 
- It is designed to simplify the development of data processing workflows and make them more accessible to users who are not familiar with programming languages such as Java.
- Pig provides a SQL-like syntax called Pig Latin, which allows users to define data processing tasks in a declarative manner. 
- Pig Latin is then compiled into MapReduce jobs that can be executed on a Hadoop cluster.
- Pig is optimized for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, where data is extracted from various sources, transformed into a desired format, and loaded into a target system. 
- Pig provides a library of built-in functions and operators for performing various data processing tasks, including filtering, aggregation, and joining.
- Pig is highly scalable and can be used to process massive amounts of data across distributed computing resources.
